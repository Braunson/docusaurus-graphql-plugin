The goal of this plugin is to generate a documentation that is pleasant to browse, based on a GraphQL schema.
The templates it generates is heavily inspired by [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference), which I enjoy browsing.

This site hosts an example of what the GitHub documentation would look like if it was generated with this plugin: [GitHub Example](./github-example/queries.md).
